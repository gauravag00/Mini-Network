It is a mini network of users having feature to suggest friends or connections. 
You have seen such feature on big social networking sites like facebook, linkedin etc.


Input: 
   line1: <your name>
   line2: <your skills in lower case separatedby comma>
  
Sample Input:
Dev
java,android,dsa,html


How these users are suggested: 
Users are suggested based on number of mutual connections, work or education 
information, networks of which you are part etc.

I have tried to do something similiar by implementing a small network using graph 
datastructure along with queue, linkedlists and unordered_map(hash table).
It will suggest users based on mutual connections, network of which you are a part,
skills similarity.
